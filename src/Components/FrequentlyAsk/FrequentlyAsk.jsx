            answer: `As Registered Migration Agents, we are bound by the 
      Code of Conduct, which prohibits any representative from giving 100% guarantees of success. 
      With this in mind, we are upfront and clear about your chances of success, and will never 
      give a false impression regarding your suitability for a visa.`,

        {
            question: 'Are your fees fixed or hourly?',
            answer: `We strongly believe in providing as much certainty to your application process as possible, 
      so we charge at a fixed rate. You'll never receive any nasty fee surprises part way through the process.`,
        },
        {
            question: 'Are consultation sessions only in-person, or do you have remote options?',
            answer: `We offer consultation sessions to suit your own personal needs, whether that be face-to-face 
      at our Docklands office, or through a range of remote means, such as phone, Zoom, or other messaging services.`,
        },
        {
            question: 'What do I get with a consultation?',
            answer: `The consultation session is an opportunity for you to receive a full written assessment outlining 
      the best strategy for you to achieve your immigration goals. Youâ€™ll also get to know a little more about us, 
      and understand our approach. There is no pressure to engage us after a consultation; you may even feel 
      confident to DIY your own application.`,
